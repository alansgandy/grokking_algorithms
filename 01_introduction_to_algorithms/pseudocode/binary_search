Define a class BinarySearch with the following methods:

1. search_iterative() Method:
    INPUT: list, item
    BEGIN
        SET low to 0
        SET high to LENGTH of list - 1

        WHILE low is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO high
            SET mid to FLOOR DIVISION of (low + high) by 2
            SET guess to list item at index mid

            IF guess EQUALS TO item THEN
                RETURN mid
            END IF

            IF guess is GREATER THAN item THEN
                SET high to mid - 1
            ELSE
                SET low to mid + 1
            END IF
        END WHILE

        RETURN None
    END

2. search_recursive() Method:
    INPUT: list, low, high, item
    BEGIN
        IF high is GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO low THEN
            SET mid to FLOOR DIVISION of (high + low) by 2
            SET guess to list item at index mid

            IF guess EQUALS TO item THEN
                RETURN mid
            END IF

            IF guess is GREATER THAN item THEN
                RETURN result of search_recursive() Method with parameters: list, low, mid - 1, item
            ELSE
                RETURN result of search_recursive() Method with parameters: list, mid + 1, high, item
            END IF
        ELSE
            RETURN None
        END IF
    END
END class definition

At MAIN:
    INITIALIZE bs as INSTANCE OF BinarySearch
    SET my_list to [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

    PRINT result of bs's search_iterative() Method with parameters: my_list, 3
    PRINT result of bs's search_iterative() Method with parameters: my_list, -1
END MAIN
